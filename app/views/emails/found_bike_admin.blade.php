<p>Hey there, this is Seth from Detroit Bike Blacklist - someone found your bike!<br>...well hopefully. They've sent you a message.</p>

<p>If the person wants you to contact them, they'll add their email or phone number to the message.</p>
<p>If you'd like to <b>send me some feedback or a comment, just reply to this email</b>.  I'd really appreciate that, even if you just want to say hi.</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>- Seth</p>

<p>P.S. Just so you know, for any email sent through the website, I get the same message in my inbox.  So if this is spam or not useful, it'll be cluttering my inbox too. I feel your pain.</p>
